# Wallpaper_Helper

This was one of my first Android projects, one that I hope to keep developing as new features and modifications are required.

Wallpaper Helper is a livewallpaper that changes the background image based upon the orientation of the device.  You can select which image is displayed when your device is in landscape and portrait modes, including how the image is cropped and scaled.
